#    1. Changed ALPHABETS set. This follows the keyboard layout and their shifted versions.
#    2. Added CONST_STRING
#    3. Added a new password generation function for GeneratePassword() and
#    deprecated the random number based password generation.
#    4. Passphrase is now Identifier + Master Password + CONST_STRING
# 12 Nov 2006
#    1. Added a new Password generation method using base64 encoding. Just use the string
#       representation of the hash and encode it as base64. This becomes the password with
#      alphanumeric characters.
#    2. Renamed the old password generation function to GeneratePasswordWithCharSet()
